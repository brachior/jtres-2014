\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Android OS uses for its applicative part, a Java-based virtual machine called Dalvik.
Java 7 introduces a new instructions set as well as a new API  specified by the \JSR
in order to improve and simplify the implementation of non-Java languages on top of the Java Virtual Machine.
A far as we know, neither the JVMs that are compatible with Java ME 8 nor
Android, while compatible at syntactical level with Java 7, implement this \Jsr.
We believe this is due to the fact that current implementations for desktop and server rely
on code generation at runtime which requires too much computing power and energy.

This paper describes our implementation of the \JSR in Dalvik.
First, we adapt the class format specification of the \JSR which is stack based and implicitly rely on the fact that the bytecode
can be rewritten at runtime, to the opcode specification of Dalvik which is register based and read only. 
Then we explain, how we represent the different kinds of method handles in Java, and how the method handles are interpreted,
using either the C interpreter for the low level method handle or a Java flexible but slow interpreter for the ``combiner`` method handles.

At the end, we present a comparison of the execution time of the different kind of calls.
This comparison shows that the implementation of the new instructions are faster than the reflection
although the Java interpreter of combiners is slowed down by frequent object creations.

\section{Overview}

  \subsection{Android}

    \ANDROID is a mobile operating system created by Google.
    It is an open-source project called ``\ANDROID Open-Source Project'' (AOSP).
    In Q2 2013, \ANDROID occupies almost 80\% of the market share with more than 187 million units shipped \cite{idc-website}.
    The success of \ANDROID can be explained by an open project and an open market
    which are very attractive for devices producers, service providers and application developers \cite{ieee-butler-android-landscape}\cite{ieee-paulson-shift-dynamic-languages}.

    \ANDROID mainly run on embedded environments like smartphones and tablets,
    and supports ARM, Intel and MIPS architecture.
    
    Even if hardwares supporting \ANDROID become more efficients,
    devices cannot as powerful as desktop computers because of miniaturization.
    Being a mobile device also requires a minimal energetic consumption.
    Moreover, \ANDROID is a portable system and adaptable to a huge number of different devices,
    forcing it to abstract itself from hardware.

    The \ANDROID architecture is described like a ``software stack'' (Figure \ref{ASA}).
    It's composed of:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item a modified version of the Linux kernel.
        It offers an hardware abstraction, an existing memory, process managements and a security and networking models;
      \item native libraries (C/C++)
        which provide most of features in the \ANDROID system;
      \item a virtual machine called ``\DALVIK''
        which run the application written in Java but converted to the \DEX format.
        \DALVIK uses the core API of Java written from scratch
        which can be assimilated to the version 5 or 6 of the Java API;
      \item an application framework to enable the making of \ANDROID applications;
      \item and some default applications.
    \end{itemize}

    \subsubsection{Differences between the JVM and \DALVIK}

      The main difference between these two machines is that \DALVIK is register based while the \JVM is stack based.
      A stack based virtual machine (VM) uses more instructions to manipulate data and to implement Java code than a register based VM.
      But the register based VM instructions tends to be larger in terms of code size\cite{ieee-paul-kundu-energy-perspective}.

      \begin{figure}[!h]
        \centering \resizebox{\linewidth}{!}{\input{figures/tikz_struct_jar_apk}}
        \caption{structure of JAR and APK files.}\vspace{-1em}
        \label{SJA}
      \end{figure}

      The Java bytecode is given in a ``.class'' file and contains the code of a unique class (Figure \ref{SJA}).
      The file is made of a series of tables which describes various informations, the code of the class and some other things.
      The code contains references to these tables.
      Among these tables, the constant-pool stores most of the constant values of the class (numbers or texts)
      and more evolved elements (data types, class names, attribute names, \dots).

      At the opposite, \DEX format contains all the code of the application (Figure \ref{SJA}).
      It is a read-only format, loaded in one piece, so the code cannot be changed or modified at runtime.
      Duplicate constants such as strings used in multiple class files
      are included only once in the \DEX file to save space.
      Unlike the \JVM, \DALVIK uses one constant-pool by type of constant
      except for the primitive types which are directly encoded within the opcode.
      It leads more smaller indexes for instructions.\\

        \caption{\ANDROID application tools-chain.}
        \label{DTC}
      \end{figure}

      \DALVIK cannot directly execute Java bytecode.
      It first has to translate the Java bytecode to the \DALVIK specific one called \DEX
      which can then be optimized (dxopt) in a binary format (\mbox{ODEX}) to save space (Figure \ref{DTC}).

  \subsection{Java Specification Request 292}

    The \JSR is a request from \JCP and led by \SUN from 2006 to 2011.
    It had been integrated in 2011 in the version 7 of Java,
    modifying both the Java language specification and the \JVM specification.

    Since late 90's, a lot of language
    implementors have chosen the JVM as their target platform \cite{wiki-jvm-lang},
    for several reasons such as the size of the ecosystem,
    the presence of mature GCs and Just In Time compilers (JITs).

    The aim of this \Jsr is to ease the implementation of dynamically typed languages
    by providing a new way to do function calls that allows language implementors
    to describe a specific semantics, independently of the semantics of the Java language.

    This \Jsr is composed of two parts, the first part, specifying the semantics of
    newly introduced opcodes and the second part defining an API: ``java.lang.invoke''.\\
    This API allows to create runtime type safe function pointers (as java.lang.invoke.MethodHandle)
    and methods to combine those pointers to do things like composition, arguments conversion,
    arguments permutation, \dots

    The next sections will present the new API and instructions but before that,
    we want to introduce an example that we will use for the rest of the paper.

    \subsubsection{Example}
      Let suppose we have the following code in Groovy \cite{lang-groovy}:

      \input{figures/snip_foo_groovy}

      It prints {\it '11'} and {\it 'test2'}.
      For the first call to {\bf foo}, {\bf a} is an integer so the symbol {\bf +} refers
      to the function {\it +(int,int)} while for the second call to {\bf foo}, {\bf a} is a string, {\bf +} refers to the function {\it +(String,String)}.

      If one try to translate this code to Java bytecode, it would be something like:

      \input{figures/snip_foo_bytecode}

      As you can see, the Java bytecode is typed, each instruction is prefixed 
      by the type of the operand ('a' for object, 'i' for integer, etc)
      and the method call (invokevirtual) specifies the type of the receiver and its parameters;
      an object (java/lang/Object) followed by an integer (I) ; and its return type
      which is also an object in the example.

      The code above does not work because invokevirtual is an existing Java bytecode that calls
      a virtual method using the Java semantics so the Java Virtual Machine or more precisely
      the bytecode verifier will check that there is an existing method '+' on java.lang.Object
      that takes an integer and returns an Object. If you have already used Java, you know
      that this method does not exist. The bytecode verification will then fail.

      Another possible translation is to use a cascade of if ... instanceof.

      \input{figures/snip_foo_java}

      While this code works, it supposes that all the potentials variations of + are known at compile time,
      something which is not true in most dynamically typed languages (Ruby, Groovy or Dart allows users to add
      new versions of any operations).
      This code can also be slow because in real languages, the number of if ... instanceof branches
      can be greater than a dozen. 

      To solve these issues, the \Jsr introduces a new bytecode named invokedynamic which has no predefined
      linking semantics and let an external Java\footnote{or any languages that can be compiled to Java bytecode} code
      named the bootstrap method to specify the linking semantics.
      This method returns a CallSite object which is a box that contains a method handle (a function pointer)
      that will be used for the subsequent calls.

      The classes (MethodHandle, MethodType, CallSite, etc.) specified by the \Jsr are grouped into a new
      package called ``java.lang.invoke'' and are directly understood by the \JVM.
      These classes answer to one or more problems coming from Dynamically typed languages optimizations or implementations.

    \subsubsection{invoke-dynamic and MethodHandle}

      The bootstrap method is called the first time the invokedynamic opcode is encountered by the interpreter,
      with the context where the opcode is located i.e.~the declaring class (encapsulated in a Lookup object),
      a symbolic name and the declared parameter types as a MethodType.
      Any subsequent execution of the invokedynamic opcode will call the function pointer
      stored inside the CallSite object returned by the bootstrap method.
      
      For our example, the code of {\bf foo} with invokedynamic is

      \input{figures/snip_foo_indy}

      The first time that {\bf foo} is executed, the bootstrap method of the class RT will be called, with a lookup object corresponding to the class containing {\bf foo},
      the string {\bf ``+''} and a MethodType corresponding to the descriptor:\\``(LObject;I)LObject;'' (Figure \ref{fooBSM}).

      \begin{figure}[!h]
        \centering \input{figures/snip_foo_bsm}\vspace{-1.5em}
        \caption{Example - bootstrap method.}
        \label{fooBSM}
      \end{figure}

      Moreover, invokedynamic comes with an API that allows to create several data patterns
      dynamically and lazily like for example a tree of if ... instanceof branches.

    \subsubsection{MethodType}

      A method type represents the types of the arguments and the return value accepted and returned by a method handle,
      or expected by a method handle caller, i.e. a method type represents a method signature.

      All method types are immutable and can only be created by static factory methods,
      allowing implementation to intern them when necessary. 
      In our example, we need three method types (Figure \ref{fooMTS}), one for each method that we have to call:
      the ``check'' method; and the two methods ``plus''.

      \begin{figure}[!h]
        \centering \input{figures/snip_foo_methods}\vspace{-1.5em}
        \caption{Example - methods with method types.}\vspace{-1em}
        \label{fooMTS}
      \end{figure}

    \subsubsection{MethodHandle / MethodHandles}
      \label{MH}

      A method handle is a runtime type checked, directly executable reference to
      either an underlying method, constructor, field, or similar low-level operations.
      It can also represent a combiner operation that is the result of a high order function
      that takes one or more method handles as input and applies operations like an argument transformation,
      a function compositions, etc.
      The former kind of method handle is called a {\it direct method handle},
      the later is called a {\it combiner method handle}.

      To guarantee runtime type safety, each method handle embodies a method type (of type java.lang.invoke.MethodType)
      that describes the parameter types and the return type that a method handle accepts.
      When a method handle is called, the method type is checked using different semantics depending on the
      type of call.

      There are two kinds of method handle call semantics:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item the exact call semantics, in that case, the declared type of the arguments (and return value) at a call site
              must be exactly the same as the types of the method type.
        \item the generic call semantics, in that case, the arguments can be converted using subtyping conversions,
              widening primitive conversions, boxing and unboxing conversions and varargs conversions
              as defined in the Java Language Specification.
      \end{itemize}
      None of these semantics implement the calling semantics as defined by the Java Virtual Machine Specification
      for classical Java method calls like invokestatic or invokevirtual
      \footnote{There is also a minor difference between the generic call semantics and the call semantics of
        the Java Language Specification, if the method is a varargs and the call as the same number of parameters as the method.
        The generic call semantics will not try to do the varargs conversion if the last parameter is not an array.}.
      The exact call semantics is more strict, and the generic call semantics is more permissive than the classical call semantics.

      Now, back to our example, in order to find the right target method (addition or concatenation),
      but for that we need to inspect the runtime type (the class exactly) of the argument of the call.
      The values of the arguments are not available when the bootstrap method is called, at linking time,
      so we use an intermediary method, named {\bf change} in the code below (Figure \ref{fooCHANGE}),
      that will be registered as target method for the first call.
      When this method will be called, the argument are known, and we can decide which target method to call.

      \begin{figure}[!h]
        \centering \input{figures/snip_foo_callsite}\vspace{-1.5em}
        \caption{Example - mutable call site.}\vspace{-.25em}
        \label{fooMCS}
      \end{figure}

      Because the method {\bf change} can be called for any operations, neither the number of parameters nor the type
      of the parameters are known before the bootstrap method is called. So the method {\bf change} takes an array of
      Object as parameters, and the combiner asCollector and asType are used to do the argument transformations
      that will takes all the arguments and wrap them in an array of Object.

      Moreover, the semantics of invokedynamic allow to do a re-link at runtime, by calling the method setTarget
      on a CallSite (see below). So the method {\bf change} takes a CallSite as first parameter, this parameter
      will be curried using the combiner bindTo.
       
      Thus, in the example, we convert each argument to an Object using asType,
      we collect them to form the array of Objects with asCollector and
      we add the call site at first argument with bindTo (Figure \ref{fooMCS}).

      \noindent This adaptation forms the tree of the Figure \ref{ast1}.

      % graph 1
      \begin{figure}[!h]
        \centering \resizebox{.7\linewidth}{!}{\input{figures/tikz_ast_1}}
        \caption{Method handles tree - bootstrap method.}\vspace{-1em}
        \label{ast1}
      \end{figure}

      When the call site is created, the method handle tree is called, so the {\bf change} method is called.
      This method takes a look at the dynamic type of {\bf a} (let say an integer),
      finds the corresponding implementation of the {\bf plus} method
      and then re-links a method handles tree represented by a combiner called {\bf GuardWithTest}
      which is equivalent to a test {\bf if .. then .. else}.

      There is no existing method handle in the API that are able to do a class check,
      but it's easy to construct one. The method named {\bf check} checks if an argument class
      is identical to a class object taken as parameter and this parameter is curried
      (using insertArguments) to the class we need to check.

      The {\bf GuardWithTest} combiner uses the {\bf check} method to verify the class of {\bf a}.
      If the type of {\bf a} is an integer it will directly call the same implementation of {\bf plus};
      otherwise as a fallback, it will call the method {\bf change} to find a new target method.

      \begin{figure}[!h]
        \centering \input{figures/snip_foo_change}\vspace{-1.5em}
        \caption{Example - ``change'' method.}\vspace{-.7em}
        \label{fooCHANGE}
      \end{figure}

      In the example, in order to call the method {\bf check}, we have to adapt the arguments,
      the method is called with an Object and an integer, so we first need to drop the second
      argument with dropArguments and then insert the java.lang.Class corresponding to an integer
      (java.lang.Integer) with insertArguments.
      This adaptation forms the tree of the Figure \ref{ast2}.

      % graph 2

        \caption{Method handles tree - first call (integer).}\vspace{-1em}
        \label{ast2}
      \end{figure}

      If 'a' is a string, the method {\bf change} is called again,
      installing a new method handle tree testing if 'a' is a string in order to call {\it plus(String,int)Object}
      delegating to the previous method handle tree otherwise.
      This adaptation form the tree of the Figure \ref{ast3}.

        \caption{Method handles tree - second call (string).}\vspace{-1em}
        \label{ast3}
      \end{figure*}

    \subsubsection{CallSite}

      As we have seen, a CallSite is a holder for a MethodHandle, which is called its target.
      An invokedynamic instruction linked to a CallSite delegates all calls to the site's current target.
      A same CallSite object may be associated with several invokedynamic
      instructions\footnote{A CallSite can also be ``free floating'', associated with no invokedynamic,
      if you want to reuse the same mechanism to implement an interpreter in Java by example.}\\

      It has three immediate, concrete subclasses that may be either instantiated or subclassed:
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{ConstantCallSite} : If the target is constant.
        \item \textbf{MutableCallSite}  : If the target change infrequently.
        \item \textbf{VolatileCallSite} : If the target has the volatile variable semantics.
      \end{enumerate}
      A non-constant call site may be relinked by changing its target, calling ``setTarget'' on the CallSite.
      The new target must have the same type as the previous one.

\section{Android 292}
  There a few complete implementations of the \JSR, mostly two.
  The OpenJDK Hotspot VM which is the reference implementation of Java and is also used in the Oracle JDK
  and the IBM J9 implementation used in the IBM JDK.
  These implementations use several mechanisms, bytecode generation, bytecode rewriting, assembly generation
  \dots~\cite{jvmsummit-heidinga-mhimpl-2010}\cite{jvmsummit-heidinga-mhimpl-2011}\cite{jvmsummit-rose-mhimpl-2011})
  that are not suitable to use in an embedded virtual machine like \DALVIK.
  because of the computing power and the energy consumption required by such mechanisms.

  For this reason, we have developed a specific implementation of the \JSR for \DALVIK.

  Specifically for Android, because Android does not use the Java class file format specification,
  we have re-interpreted the part of the \JSR specification that describes the class file format
  in order to translate it into the DEX file format.
  We have also implemented a way to execute all APKs previously created to run with our modified VM.
  This work is described in section~\ref{newConst}.
  
  The section~\ref{implD} describe in detail the most important implementation part of our work,
  the execution of an invokedynamic opcode, a direct method handle, a combiner method handle or
  an invoker method handle by our modified VM.
  
  At the end, we will describe our results in terms of execution time and code size of our changes
  compared to a pristine Dalvik VM (section~\ref{result}).\\

\section{A new DEX format}
\label{newDEX}

  The main differences between the Java class file format and the Dalvik DEX format
  are that:
  \begin{itemize}
   \item There are several constant pools, one by type of constant.
         all are shared by the whole application
   \item The DEX format is mmapped\footnote{loaded in memory using mmap unix operation.}
    and read only at runtime.
  \end{itemize}
  
  This implies that we need to introduce new constant pools to support the new opcodes.
  Because constant pools are directly described in the header of the DEX,
  this requires a new header, making DEX file supporting the JSR 292 incompatible
  with previous DEX file.
  
  \subsection{opcodes / constants}
    The \JSR introduces 1 new opcode invokedynamic, changes the semantics of ldc (load constant)
    to support loading constant method types and constant method handles and enhances the semantics
    of invokevirtual for the method MethodHandle.invokeExact and MethodHandle.invoke.

    Instead of overloading the already existing semantics, in Dalvik, we introduces several new opcodes,
    ``invoke-dynamic'' that does an invokedynamic,
    ``const-methodtype'' and ``const-methodhandle'' that respectively load a constant method type
    and a constant method handle and ``invokeExact'' and ``invoke'' which require that the first parameter
    is a MethodHandle.

    The program ``dx'' (Figure \ref{DTC}) was modified to take Java bytecode and 
    transform the Java opcode or Java invokevirtual to the corresponding instructions.

  \subsection{constant-pools}
    \label{CP}

    To support the newly introduced opcodes, we had to add 4 new constant pools,
    one for constant method type, one for constant method handle, one for invokedynamic
    and one for the bootstrap arguments. (Figure \ref{SNA}).

    \begin{figure}[!h]
      \centering \resizebox{.45\linewidth}{!}{\input{figures/tikz_struct_new_apk}}
      \caption{structure of new APK files.}
      \label{SNA}
    \end{figure}

    The MethodType entry contains an index into the prototype constant pool.
    The MethodHandle entry is described by the method handle kind (cf.~\ref{MH})
    and an index into the method or the field constant pool, according to the kind.
    The InvokeDynamic entry have indexes into the strings, the prototype,
    the method handle and the bootstrap arguments constant pools.
    And the BootstrapArguments entry contains its arguments number
    and a data block representing the arguments.
    Each argument is encoded with a tag followed by a constant pool index or
    an immediate primitive value according to the tag (Figure \ref{CPentries}).

  \subsection{Class header}

    At runtime, we need to associate the Callsite object returned by the bootstrap method
    to a live CallSite object. So in the VM we need a table that associate a CallSite
    \footnote{As an optimization, the current implementation does not store the CallSite
     but the target method handle, but the principle is the same.}
    to a specific opcode of a specific method.

    Given that in \DALVIK, the initialization of the Method structures is done when
    the class is initialized (when the vtable is filled), instead of storing a CallSite
    table in each method, we have decided to store this table at the class level.
    
    For that reason, the DEX format of a class has a supplementary field storing
    the number of all callsites for every methods of that class. 
    This number is calculated when generating the DEX file by the programe ``dx''.

  \subsection{retro-compatibility}
    \label{retro}

    As said previously, in order to introduce new constant pools, we had to change
    the header of a DEX file in an incompatible way.
    In order to support APK generated with an unaltered version of ``dx'',
    the DEX file need to be re-written something that the VM can not do
    because the DEX file is read only.

    \ANDROID has a mechanism that optimize a DEX file at the installation of
    an APK using a program named ``dxopt'' (Figure \ref{DTC}).
    We take advantage of this mechanism to at installation time rewrite the APK to use our DEX format.
    This rewrite is fast, because we only can copy the previous DEX file and only insert the
    constant pools for method types, method handles, invokedynamics and
    bootstrap arguments with a size of zero and add a 0 in the header of a class at the
    position corresponding to the CallSites table.
    The size of the DEX header and the class headers change but no offsets inside each parts.

\section{New opcodes}
\label{newConst}
  \subsection{New constants}

    We can create constant method handles only with the ``const-methodhandle'' instruction (Figure \ref{MTMHldc}) or in the arguments of a bootstrap method.
    The method handle instructions are rarely used and a bootstrap method is called once.
    Therefore it is not necessary to have a cache for method handles resolved.
    Resolve a method handle consists to find its informations into the constant-pool and create it.
    This creation can only do in Java, an up call is necessary.

    Comparing method types is common on the VM.
    To simplify and optimize these tests, we need to maintain a cache which make sure that two method types with the same signature are identical.
    A method type can be create in Java or by the VM so the cache run in Java and only Java can create a method type (the VM does an up call).
    All method types are store in the cache and a test between two method types becomes a simply equality test.
    Resolve a method type consists to find its prototype in the constant-pool and call Java to find it or create it.
    We distinguish two types of method type: some are used by the VM (strong) and must not be freed by the GC; the others (weak) can be freed by the GC if necessary.

      \centering \resizebox{.9\linewidth}{!}{\input{figures/inst_mh_mt}}
      \caption{methodtype and methodhandle constant.}\vspace{-1em}
      \label{MTMHldc}
    \end{figure}

  \subsection{New invoke instructions}
    Each instruction have two representations: a ``normal'' form and a ``range'' form.
    The ``normal'' form represents the instruction with at most 5 registers.
    And the ``range'' form can have at most 65535 registers.
    Each register is considered 32 bits wide.

    \subsubsection{invoke-exact and invoke-generic}

      invoke-exact and invoke-generic (Figure \ref{INGEins}) contain an index in the constant-pool of method types.
      This method type represents the order and types of the arguments passed to the instruction, the first argument excluded.
      The first argument is the method handle we have to call.\\

      \begin{figure}[!h]
        \centering \resizebox{.9\linewidth}{!}{\input{figures/inst_gen_exa}}
        \caption{invoke-generic/exact instruction.}\vspace{-1em}
        \label{INGEins}
      \end{figure}

    \subsubsection{invoke-dynamic}

      An invoke-dynamic (Figure \ref{INDYins}) contains an integer corresponding to the call site number and an index in the constant-pool of invoke-dynamic.
      This entry in the invoke-dynamic constant pool have all informations that we need to treat this instruction: bootstrap method, arguments,
      \dots~A new opcode format has been added.

      \begin{figure}[!h]

        \caption{invoke-dynamic instruction.}\vspace{-1em}
        \label{INDYins}
      \end{figure}

\section{Implementation details}
\label{implD}

    \subsection{MethodHandle}
      Method handles can be divide in three parts (Figure \ref{mhHier}):
      \begin{itemize}
        \item direct method handles which are treated by a call to the method {\bf invoke} or {\bf invokeExact};
        \item combiners which require specific treatments;
        \item and invokers which simulate an ``invoke'' or ``invokeExact'' call.
      \end{itemize}

      \begin{figure}[!h]
        \centering \resizebox{\linewidth}{!}{\input{figures/tikz_mh_hierarchy}}
        \caption{Method handles hierarchy.}
        \label{mhHier}
      \end{figure}

      Each part gathers different kinds of method handle.
      The ``direct'' part contains all method handles which do an invoke (virtual, direct, static, \dots)
      and a field access (get, put) with a possible ``static'' and ``volatile'' form.
      The ``combiner'' part aggregates all method handles that we cannot call directly.
      We treat these method handles with a specific interpreter detailed in section \ref{combiners}.
      The last part ("invoker") is formed by special method handles which need a specific manipulation in the Dalvik interpreter.
      Each part is treated differently by the Dalvik interpreter.

      We distinguish all kinds of method handle with several binary masks to perform dispatch between the different treatments.

      \begin{figure}[!h]
        \centering \input{figures/snip_methodhandle}\vspace{-1.5em}
        \caption{Method handle fields.}
        \label{mhFields}
      \end{figure}

      A MethodHandle is describe by: the declaring class; the method type; the kind and the slot corresponding to the method/field/\dots

    \subsection{invoke instructions}
      All new instructions work with a method handle so we have written a method, inside the interpreter, which treats a method handle.
      It invokes the method, gets or sets a field and calls the method handle interpreter depending to the kind of the method handle.
      It also uses the interpreter mechanism to store the return value.
      This method is called ``invokeMethodHandle''.

    \subsubsection{invoke-exact and invoke-generic}
      invoke-exact is the instruction with the most simple implementation.
      If the two method types (contained in the instruction and in the method handle) are equals we call the method handle,
      else an exception is thrown.\\
      
      invoke-generic works like an invoke-exact but if the method types differ, we try to adapt arguments.
      Different treatments can be done:
      if the number of arguments is the same between the two method types, we try to convert arguments;
      if we have a variadic signature, we collect and convert arguments to match the method type of the method handle;
      else an exception is thrown.
      When the arguments match the method signature, we call the method handle.
  
    \subsubsection{invoke-dynamic}
      The call site is found in the current class but if it is the first time that we read this instruction, the call site is not created yet.
      In this case, we need to call the bootstrap method associated to the instruction first.
      So we decode the arguments of the bootstrap method and do an up call to the method ``callBootstrapMethod''.% (Figure \ref{implBSM}).
      It returns a call site that is stored in the class.

      \begin{figure}[!h]
        \centering \input{figures/snip_meth_bsm}\vspace{-1.5em}
        \caption{snippet - ``callBootstrapMethod''.}\vspace{-1em}
        \label{implBSM}
      \end{figure}

      A bootstrap method needs at least three arguments:
      a lookup (Lookup) that is a security token object encapsulating access rights of class containing the invoke-dynamic opcode;
      an arbitrary name (String) specified as parameter of the invokedynamic opcode;
      a method type (MethodType), that is a reified object of the descriptor specified as parameter of the invoke-dynamic opcode;
      and any constant values specified as bootstrap arguments of the invoke-dynamic opcode.

      At first, we have to create the lookup from the given  declaring class.
      We treat the bootstrap method differently if arguments are given or not.
      If no argument are given, we call directly the bootstrap method
      with ``invokeExact'' and basic arguments (types are known).
      We add the basic arguments into the other arguments.
      We do not want strong method types into the bootstrap arguments,
      therefore they are represented by strings which are translated to method types.
      Because arguments are seen like an array of Object,
      we have to call the ``invoke'' method.
      The ``invoke'' method needs the true signature when it is called,
      so we have to dispatch arguments to create the real signature.
      To do that, we call the method ``invokeWithArguments'' (Figure \ref{implIWA})
      which calls the method invoke according to the number of arguments.
      ``invokeWithArguments'' is separated on many functions to allow optimizations by the JIT.

%       \begin{figure}[!h]
%         \centering \input{figures/snip_meth_iwa}\vspace{-1.5em}
%         \caption{snippet - ``invokeWithArguments''.}
%         \label{implIWA}
%       \end{figure}

      When the CallSite is returned, we verify its integrity.
      We check if it or its target is not null and if the target's type and the type given are the same.
      Because the target's CallSite could be uninitialized we have to check if the target contains a method handle or a method type.

      When the bootstrap method returns its value, we have to store the call site.
      And because this instruction can be read by many threads, we use an atomic ``compare-and-set'' mechanism.
      When we have the call site, we get its method handle.
      All method handles are volatiles so we have to get it atomically.
      At the end, we call it.

    \subsection{Combiners}
    \label{combiners}

      A part of method handles allows to manipulate arguments, we call them: ``combiners''.
      Combiners can contain several method handles and at least one direct method handle.
      Thereby, we can represent them by trees, referred to here as method handles trees.

      Executing a combiner is often equivalent to executing many.
      Given that combiners cannot be final calls,
      it is not interesting to do real calls, ie.~put on the execution stack,
      each combiner and at the end call the direct method handle, which needs a real call.

      To execute direct method handles, we have to use the ``invoke-exact'' and ``invoke-generic'' instructions.
      But we cannot call them through the interpreter, we can only do in Java.
      To avoid a Java up call for each combiner, we have chosen to write an interpreter,
      specific to execution of combiners, in Java (Figure \ref{implINTERP}).

      \begin{figure}[!h]
        \centering \input{figures/snip_meth_interp}\vspace{-1em}
        \caption{snippet - ``invokeCombiner''.}
        \label{implINTERP}
      \end{figure}

      This interpreter is implemented using a continuation mechanism (context) to treat the return value.
      Each combiner execute its own code and can produce a 'context'.
      For example, AsType converts arguments and produces a context if it has to convert the return value.
      When the interpreter treats a direct method handle,
      which means a method handle produced by a call to ``lookup.findXXX(\dots)'' (instance, static, getter, \dots),
      it does an invoke-generic and check if a context exist.
      If there is a context, the interpreter executes the second part of the method handle
      and convert the return value in the case of AsType.
      Afterwards, the interpreter repeats the loop.

      This implementation avoids to pile up a call in the stack for each method handle.
      We pile up only if we have a direct method handle, which is not a subtree.

    \subsection{Invokers}

      Among method handles, we call "invoker" those which are high order method handles.
      An invoker extracts the method handle passed as first argument and calls it with the rest of arguments.
      Its job is to simulate a call to the method ``invokeExact'' (exactInvoker) and ``invoke'' (invoker).
      The method type of an invoker is the same as the method handle it have to call with a MethodHandle at first parameter.

      Because we cannot simulate an ``invoke-exact'' in Java, we have to add support code in the Dalvik interpreter.
      And to avoid unnecessary up calls, we treat the generic invoker in the interpreter too.
      Each invoker can be executed either by the ``invoke'' method or by the ``invokeExact'' method, so we have four call semantics.

      In the Dalvik interpreter, the execution of an invoker acts as an optimized tail call.
      The method handle to call (invokee) is extracted from the first argument and the other arguments are shifted.
      Then the interpreter executes itself again using a goto.
      In order to perform the second pointer check, we store the expected method type of the invokee as a field of the MHInvoker class (Figure \ref{invokeeFields}).

      \begin{figure}[!h]
        \centering \input{figures/snip_mh_invoker}\vspace{-1.5em}
        \caption{Method handle invokee fields.}
        \label{invokeeFields}
      \end{figure}

      A problem remains when we want to execute the generic invoker with the semantics of ``invoke-exact''.
      Reproducing the ``invoke-generic'' behavior requires to copy a lot of code so,
      we choose to do an up call to the method ``invokeWithArguments'' which calls the method ``invoke''.

      Method handles contains also others invokers (``spreadInvoker'' and ``dynamicInvoker'') but we are able to treat them like combiners.

\section{Result}
 \label{result}

  The modifications made to run the \JSR have a cost in terms of code.
  About 2600 lines of code were required to tell {\bf dx} how to translate new instructions.
  Dalvik was given about 3200 lines of code excluding duplications of code for each interpreter.
  And finally, the introduction of the package ``java/lang/invoke'' asked about 7000 lines of code in the Java API.

%   \fixme{impact sur le binaire (4.4.3/4.4.3.292) libdvm(718992/739484) [20k]; android.jar(20522674/20533106) [20k]; dalvikvm(9500/9500)}

  In terms of binary size, the library containing the interpreter (libdvm.so) increases by twenty kilo-bytes as well as the Java API in the SDK (android.jar).
  A DEX file size increases proportionally in respect to the number of classes.
  Figure \ref{Rsize} shows some DEX file sizes contained in Android.
  We are able to note that the impact of our implementation is faint if the program does not use the \JSR.

  \begin{figure}[h]
    \pgfplotstableread{
      %4.4.3    %4.4.3.292

    }\dataset
    \resizebox{\linewidth}{!}{\input{figures/tikz_res_sizes}}
    \caption{DEX file size comparison.}
    \label{Rsize}
  \end{figure}

  To compare performances of new instructions and the reflection API,
  we have written a test which calls N times a method using different ways (instructions and reflection).
  This test is executed using \DALVIK without graphical.

  \begin{figure}[!h]
    \resizebox{\linewidth}{!}{\input{figures/tikz_res_invokes}}
    \caption{JSR 292 instructions vs reflection API.}
    \label{Rinvoke}
  \end{figure}

  Figure \ref{Rinvoke} shows results for 10000, 100000 and 1000000.
  Below these values, we cannot see strictly the differences between each kind of execution.
  We notice that calls to ``invoke-exact'' and to ``invoke-generic'' with the right method type (behaving as an ``invoke-exact'') are faster than others.
  ``invoke-dynamic'' takes a bit more time because it have to get a volatile method handle.
  Regarding ``invoke-generic'' with a method type different to the final call, the execution time increases.
  This difference is due to the boxing mechanism which creates new objects.
  However, ``invoke-generic'' remains faster than the reflection API which requires to box all arguments and create an array of Object.\\
  
  Another test executes the example described in this article.
  We call N times a method which takes an Object and calls the right method according to the dynamic type of the argument.
  We compare the execution time of the example using the instanceof mechanism, the reflection API and the method handle interpreter.

  \begin{figure}[!h]
    \resizebox{\linewidth}{!}{\input{figures/tikz_res_mutable}}
    \caption{Method handle interpreter vs classic Java calls.}\vspace{-1em}
    \label{Rmutable}
  \end{figure}

  We notice on Figure \ref{Rmutable} that our method handle interpreter is really slow.
  The method handle interpreter manipulates arguments.
  It have to create an array each time a reduce or an increase of the arguments number happens.

\section{Related Works}

  Currently, the OpenJDK is the only open-source implementation of the \JSR.
  This JSR has often evolved since its request in 2006\cite{jcp-jsr-292}.
  In 2009, a paper of John R. Rose (\JSR spec leader) describes an implementation of the \Jsr, now obsolete\cite{vmil-rose-indy-2009}.
  In 2010, John R. Rose and al. published a paper presenting the implementation in the JDK 7\cite{pppj-rose-indy-2010}.
  Today, no paper explains the LambdaForm-based implementation of the JDK 8.

  We don't find any implementation of the \JSR on an embedded virtual machine.
  Note also that the \Jsr 360 (describing the embedded part of the JDK) specify that the ``invokedynamic'' instruction is not included\cite{jcp-jsr-360}.



  At the time of the writing, our implementation is not fast enough to be used in production, we have focused on the conformance of the \JSR.
  To simplify the implementation, we have just integrated our solution in the ``portable'' interpreter written in C and not in assembler code.

\section{Conclusion}

  This implementation of the \JSR associates the ``invoke'' and ``invokeExact'' methods to specific instructions
  and defines an interpreter written in Java to treat method handles trees (combiners).
  We noted that the execution times of the new instructions are better than those of the reflexion.
  However, the method handles trees interpreter suffers lot of slowing down because of frequent object creations.
  
  To solve this problem, we will envisage to limit the object creation numbers in evaluating the maximum number of a method handles tree arguments
  and we will try to see the C variables stack as an object in Java.

\section{Get and compile the project}

  Our project is divided into several parts.
  The main parts are the changes to the Java API (libcore-292\cite{bb-libcore}) and those of Dalvik and ``dx'' (dalvik-292\cite{bb-dalvik}).
  To compile our project, you need to download each part and sources of Android.
  To simplify this task, we put a project on BitBucket called ``Android 292''\cite{bb-android}.
  Once recovered, a python script (aosp.py) allows to recover the entire project:

  {\scriptsize \begin{verbatim}
    python aosp.py
  \end{verbatim}}\vspace{-.8em}

  To compile the project, you must be on a GNU/Linux 64bits machine and initialize your environment to compile the AOSP\cite{android-sources}.
  Once your environment ready, type the following commands:
 
  {\scriptsize \begin{verbatim}
    export EXPERIMENTAL_USE_JAVA7=true
    source build/envsetup.sh
    lunch full-eng # see README.md for more details
    make
  \end{verbatim}}\vspace{-.8em}

  Once the project is compiled, you can run the emulator by typing:

  {\scriptsize \begin{verbatim}
    emulator
  \end{verbatim}}\vspace{-.8em}

  Be sure to use the ``portable'' interpreter:

  {\scriptsize \begin{verbatim}
    adb shell stop
    adb shell setprop dalvik.vm.execution-mode int:portable
    adb shell start
  \end{verbatim}}\vspace{-.8em}

  Regarding the SDK, the commands are:

  {\scriptsize \begin{verbatim}
    export EXPERIMENTAL_USE_JAVA7=true
    source build/envsetup.sh
    lunch sdk-eng
    make sdk
  \end{verbatim}}\vspace{-.8em}

  The compiled project will produce an archive named:\\
  ``android-sdk\_eng.{\it XXX}\_linux-x86.zip''
  ({\it XXX} fits your login).
  Unzip it and add the SDK to your IDE as a classic Android SDK.
